    <h4>"POSTVIRTUAL..."</h4>
    <p>
      Virtualization ....
      Dematerialization, a tentacular phenomenon penetrating domains of finance, industry, art and social behaviour, is a multifaceted concept encompassing many forms of disappearance or removal of physical material(s) from processes or phenomena (e.g., Bitcoin, conceptual art, social media, etc..). While virtualization often produces increased affordability, efficiency and sustainability (or - more critically - the illusion thereof), the usually consequent dematerialization presents a host of downsides such as decreased accessibility, security and interpersonal engagement,.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, there is a growing body of literature documenting the variety of factors contributing to decreased involvement in online settings, whether it is attributed to technological limitations (e.g. latency/lag), attentional saturation brought on by multitasking (especially in the realm of social media) or various other psychological phenomena (e.g. the obfuscation of body language). In its intangibility alone, virtualization tends to afford less immediately intuitive interaction, disincentivizing involvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While long predating and far outspanning the past two epidemiologically-specific years, it has been daunting to see the acceleration of these processes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The virtualization of society, from labour to education, entertainment to sustenance, is not a novel phenomenon, but its viral expansion, hegemonic embedding and institutional establishment since late 2019 commands awe and a renewed sense of urgency in delimiting its contours, understanding its pitfalls and considering its alternatives.
    </p>

    <h4>"...STEGANODILDONICS"</h4>
    <p style="text-indent:0px">
      Haptic (from the Ancient Greek ἅπτω, ‘to touch, affect’): of or relating to the sense of touch<br>
      Haptic technology: technology permitting haptic information transmission (e.g. vibration motor in cell phones)<br>
      Telehaptics: haptic technology supporting remote information transmission (e.g. telesurgery apparatus)<br>
      Teledildonics: telehaptics revolving around sexual activity (e.g. Bluetooth-enabled sex toys)<br>
      Onion dildonics: teledildonics involving principles of cybersecurity (e.g. tor routing)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise of teledildonics has led to a “world of connected sex toys […] without regards to what consent, privacy, or security means in that context” (Sarah Jamie Lewis, in <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix" target="_blank">Burgess, 2018</a>). While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ToyControl/" target="_blank">certain subcommunities</a> openly advertise anonymous teledildonic activity, there exists in the general population a strong concern of hacking - <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3139937.3139942" target="_blank">far from unreasonble</a> in the case of Bluetooth Low Energy devices - which has led to the emergence of onion dildonics, a field of encrypted teledildonics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering onion routing as one form of cyberencryption among many, we can frame onion dildonics as a fragment of a broader realm of cryptodildonics. This rebranding conjures an analogical contrast between cryptography and steganography, in which the former seeks to encrypt the meaning of the message using a cipher (e.g. Caesar’s code) whereas the latter attempts to hide the very existence of the message itself (e.g. <span style="color:#f1f1f1">invisible ink</span>). I therefore propose to develop a field of steganodildonics, which promises cybersexual security via inconspicuous dissimulation.

    <p> Telomatic is an exploration of intersubjectivity through sculptural electronic art. <br> Drawing inspiration from technology ethics, telematic art and crypto-anarchism, this project seeks to comment on and propose playfully engaging solutions to the dematerialization of contemporary virtualized landscapes as well as address concerns of cybersecurity in our increasingly connected age. </p>
    <p> An interactive apparatus reverse-engineering embodied possibilities of telematic experience, Telomatic arose in an attempt to address these issues in a conceptually lighthearted way, using a disruptively telehaptic anal plug. On a surface level, this can appear to create a hyperspecific solution to re-engage users, a metamodern techno-commercial approach only post-ironically addressing the alienation of dematerialization. Yet, pragmatically dysfunctional and essentially meaningless without the conscious, critical and convivial involvement of its beholders, this artificially reincarnated object eschews practical application in favour of theoretical critique, problematizing the very notion of user engagement through absurdist excess. </p>
    <p> Telomatic also exists to explore the notion of cybersecurity in a time of increasing (awareness of the) fragility of our digital identities. The rise of teledildonics - remote haptic technology involving sexuality - has further accelerated discussion around the meaning of consent, privacy and security online. While certain subcommunities openly invite anonymous teledildonic activity, there exists in the general population a strong concern of hacking, specifically in the case of popular but low-security toys using Bluetooth Low Energy protocols. This has led to the emergence of onion dildonics, a field concerned with the cybersecurity of teledildonics. </p>
    <p> Framing onion dildonics as a fragment of a broader realm of cryptodildonics, we can consider the analogical distinction between cryptography and steganography, in which the former seeks to encrypt the meaning of the message using a cipher whereas the latter attempts to hide the very existence of the message itself. Telomatic proposes to eschew traditional principles of cryptographic cybersecurity in favour of steganography, heralding the advent of steganodildonics and promising cybersexual security via inconspicuous dissimulation. </p>

    <p>illiez is a human being currently residing in Tiohtià:ke. A creative fabricator, illiez uses a
      variety of media in an attempt to shed light on the alterity and alienation that can arise from
      intersubjective experience, most often using the body – whether physical object or conceptual
      framework – as a starting point for these explorations. Usually idiosyncratic, frequently private
      and sometimes selfish, the outcome is usually situated at an ever-shifting barycenter of
      electronic, sculptural, biological and performance arts. The practice is also subjected to the
      gravitational pull of poetry, technique and science, all of which distort the erratic, autotelic and
      ultimately futile creative process.</p>
      <p>Pacifying cryptographic pathorrhea – receptive and/or extrusive – fuels a simple quest to
        understand and be understood by others. From there, either fulfillment manifests in enthusiastic
        collaborative amusement or failure devolves into cathartic softcore masochism – physical,
        psychological and/or technical.</p>
        <p>Underlying yearnings are to ogle perceptual spaces outside the self, inquisitively reframe topical
          epistemologies and contribute to diversifying cognitive topographies.</p>
          <p>Tools used to this end include skin, circuits, silicone, software, sound and so on.</p>
          <p>Mischievious, but earnest.</p>
