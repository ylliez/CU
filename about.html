    <h4>"POSTVIRTUAL..."</h4>
    <p>
      The increasingly seamless integration of the Internet and other forms of cybercommunications networking in everyday life demands an equally increasing availablility of online products, services and spaces. This phenomenon of virtualization often, though not necessarily, occurs alongside dematerialization, which conversely considers the disappearance or removal of physical material(s) from processes or phenomena (e.g., Bitcoin, conceptual art, social media, etc..). While virtualization can produce increases in affordability, efficiency and sustainability (or the illusion thereof), dematerialization usually presents a host of downsides such as decreased accessibility, security and interpersonal engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, there is a growing body of literature documenting the variety of factors contributing to decreased involvement in online settings, whether it is attributed to technological limitations (e.g. latency/lag), attentional saturation brought on by multitasking (especially in the realm and wake of social media) or various other psychological phenomena (e.g. the obfuscation of body language). In its intangibility alone, online situations tends to afford less immediately intuitive interaction, disincentivizing involvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While long predating and far outspanning the past two epidemiologically-specific years, it has been daunting to see the acceleration of these processes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The virtualization of society, from labour to education, entertainment to sustenance, is not a novel phenomenon, but its viral expansion and institutional establishment since late 2019 commands awe and a renewed sense of urgency in delimiting its contours, understanding its pitfalls and considering its alternatives.

    <h4>"...STEGANODILDONICS"</h4>
    <p class="xind">
      Haptic (from the Ancient Greek ἅπτω, ‘to touch, affect’): of or relating to the sense of touch<br>
      Haptic technology: technology permitting haptic information transmission (e.g. vibration motor in cell phones)<br>
      Telehaptics: haptic technology supporting remote information transmission (e.g. telesurgery apparatus)<br>
      Teledildonics: telehaptics revolving around sexual activity (e.g. Bluetooth-enabled sex toys)<br>
      Onion dildonics: teledildonics involving principles of cybersecurity (e.g. tor routing)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise of teledildonics has led to a “world of connected sex toys […] without regards to what consent, privacy, or security means in that context” (Sarah Jamie Lewis, in <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix" target="_blank">Burgess, 2018</a>). While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ToyControl/" target="_blank">certain subcommunities</a> openly advertise anonymous teledildonic activity, there exists in the general population a strong concern of hacking - <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3139937.3139942" target="_blank">far from unreasonble</a> in the case of Bluetooth Low Energy devices - which has led to the emergence of onion dildonics, a field of encrypted teledildonics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering onion routing as one form of cyberencryption among many, we can frame onion dildonics as a fragment of a broader realm of cryptodildonics. This rebranding conjures an analogical contrast between cryptography and steganography, in which the former seeks to encrypt the meaning of the message using a cipher (e.g. Caesar code) whereas the latter attempts to hide the very existence of the message itself (e.g. <span style="color:#f1f1f1">invisible ink</span>). I therefore propose to develop a field of steganodildonics, which promises cybersexual security via inconspicuous dissimulation.

      Telomatic is an exploration of intersubjectivity through sculptural electronic art, drawing inspiration from technology ethics, telematic art and crypto-anarchism to comment on and propose playfully engaging solutions to the dematerialization of contemporary virtualized landscapes as well as address concerns of cybersecurity in our increasingly connected age.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an object, Telomatic is a purpose-built telehaptic anal plug activated by an ad hoc smartphone application. A circuit consisting of vibration motor connected to a bluetooth-capable microcontroller was encapsulated in a silicone cast. An application was then developed to wirelessly control the device's activation intensity and pattern using the horizontal and vertical position of finger touch events on the user interface, an unassuming drawing canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first intention of this project is to re-embody online experiences, drawing attention to the creeping alienation of dematerialization. Although addressed at best post-ironically through a hyperspecific solution using a metamodern techno-commercial approach, Telomatic does provide an alternative to the reflexive concurrence of virtualization and dematerialization, proposing to perpetuate material experience in the face of rampant virtualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telomatic also offers an alternative to cryptographic cyberesecurity, harnessing principles of steganography to hide information in plain sight. Here, the manipulation of the device is carried out via the interface of a functionally unrelated application, the purpose of which is completely opaque to the unwitting user, provide an unconventional form of security reliant on software obfuscationg as well as user disinterest.

      illiez is a human being currently residing in Tiohtià:ke. A creative fabricator, illiez uses a variety of media in an attempt to shed light on the alterity and alienation that can arise from intersubjective experience, most often using the body – whether physical object or conceptual framework – as a starting point for these explorations. Usually idiosyncratic, frequently private and sometimes selfish, the outcome is usually situated at an ever-shifting barycenter of electronic, sculptural, biological and performance arts. The practice is also subjected to the gravitational pull of poetry, technique and science, all of which distort the erratic, autotelic and ultimately futile creative process.

    <p class="xind">
      Pacifying cryptographic pathorrhea – receptive and/or extrusive – fuels a simple quest to understand and be understood by others. From there, either fulfillment manifests in enthusiastic collaborative amusement or failure devolves into cathartic softcore masochism – physical, psychological and/or technical.
