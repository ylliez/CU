      Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it? How much funding would you need to achieve the changes you seek? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? What does your answer to these questions say about the &quot;great man theory&quot; of history?

      Historical revisionism, however self-aware and cautious, is usually at
      best naively frivolous and at worst demagogically self-serving. As such, I
      am wary of straying too far from the overarchingly consensual, albeit
      sectionally sectarian, history of the Internet.

      A pacifist perspective might bemoan the congenital involvement of the
      military via the nested chain leading from the IPTO to the DoD via the
      (D)ARPA, in a fashion that echoes current concerns about government-sponsored BCI, AI and genomic programs. With no intent to exonerate the
      military-industrial complex of the ultimately tragic consequences of such
      a martial outlook, credit must pragmatically be given to the
      organizational capabilities displayed and astronomical sums marshalled by
      these organizations. Indeed, while the contemporary dematerialization,
      omnipresence and individualization of network use often belies the massive
      infrastructural scaffolding undergirding the use of the world wide web, it
      is difficult to imagine any other actor, private or public, with pockets
      deep enough and arms long enough to undertake such an expensive, arduous
      and centralized task.

      We could, with a 20(/)20 perspective, imagine that role being fulfilled by
      academic consortia or corporate oligopolies, but both have been known to
      display, however more evidently for the latter, proprietary reflexes that
      could perhaps have been less explicitly but more perniciously exclusive
      than the DoD&apos;s bureaucratic ARPANET. While the walls of the cybermilitary
      fortress were initially more impregnable - before the Netizen invasion
      forced a retreat to the MILNET keep - the still but murky waters of the
      moats surrounding MIT, Harvard and, closer to home, McGill as well as
      Microsoft, Intel and more recently Apple might ultimately (have) be(en)
      more deleterious to the ideal of a democratic, open and collaborative
      Internet.

      So what of para-institutional or non-profit groups and individuals, from
      hippies to libertarians and anarchists to hackers? Beyond the financial
      abyss separating such actors from governmental or large corporate
      instances, perhaps they fulfilled and continue to fulfill a necessary and
      sufficient role that is not one of establishment and directing but of
      contestatory oversight and grassroots regulation. A legislative and
      perhaps even judicial body, hardly an executive one.

      This might be an unimaginative perspective, not fully engaged in
      considering alternative dynamics that could have led to similar - let
      alone more ideal - cybercircumstances, such as a fully decentralized,
      democratic and open process more politically akin to free-trading
      democratic city-states than our current inter- and supra-national homogeneity,
      but I would not want to fail to adequately criticize the institutions and
      individuals for the moral and epistemological shortcomings visible in the
      wake of the Internet. A rather crude example of this would draw a parallel
      between U.S. imperialism as a whole and the development as well as
      subsequent dissemination of the Internet, finding similarities between the
      two para-/ex-militaristic semi-privatized turned soft-power epistemicidal
      endeavours through pseudo-democratic global cultural (neo)liberalization
      and self-commodification. To paraphrase a certain anti-globalist
      organisation quoting a poet:
