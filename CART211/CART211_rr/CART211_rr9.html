       It is the year 2030 and you’re hired at Concordia University to teach an interactive multimedia course named “Creative Computing & Network Culture”. You have all the technologies of digital media and network computing described in the readings at your disposal to design the most engaging educational experience ever created for your students, and serve as an example of good pedagogy to the entire world. Describe what you create.

      Well played. In the interest of explicit feedback before I get to the subcontracting work, je tiens a dire que je trouve that you've done an excellent job. Joining this introductory CompArt class on a bit of a whim, I hardly expected it to be as intellectually dense and practically supportive as it was. You struck an impressive balance between theoretical stimulation (I know I haven't always played fair with the mises en situation, but they remained engaging nonetheless) and well-gaged concrete exercises. I unfortunately don't know how much constructive suggestions I will be able to provide under the guise of a reading question. Mais tentons notre chance.

      First and foremost, it would behoove us to consider the increasingly virtualized nature of society. While in most circumstances, my reflexive approach would be to re-materialize the pedagogical practice, the inherently intangible nature of creative computing and network culture make that a bit of a purely reactionary fancy. So then, fully embrace the dematerialization? Attempts could be made to fold this issue into the educational process, such as more explicitly using the tools deployed (Zoom, Cerberus FTP, GitHub) as examples when tackling network theory. Could also consider reaping the benefits of avatar-based virtual meeting platforms such as Gather or Wonder.

      However, from the humble vantage point of a single student, it seems that one of the bigger obstacles is student engagement, or lack thereof. Closely related to the idea of students as passive objects theorized by Paolo Freire in his banking model of education, this disengagement is unfortunate for both teacher and student. While more punitive models might propose enforced engagement (e.g. calling on students by name), an alternative framework proposed by Freire considers problem-posing as a pedagogical tool. An example of this can be found in contextualized but open-ended weekly reading questions. Another example could involve similarly weekly and open-ended problem-solving exercises, centered around the elaboration of a more abstract functionality (e.g. “print visitor’s name on the page” which allows for a variety of user input as well as display approaches), solo or in groups, iteratively building on a collective project.
