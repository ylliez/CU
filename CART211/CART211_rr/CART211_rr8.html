      What sort of problems exist in the world today that could be solved with the help of network technology and new media? Why haven't they been?
      What is the best way to decide which software development and digital creative work is most important to do, and which one is not worth it?
      How could we ensure that the important work is funded, and where will the funding come from? How can we get there, from where we are today?
    </p>
    <p>
      Major problems existing in the world today include global poverty, malnourishment and ill-health, political, religious and/or cultural strife, classism,
      racism, sexism and ecological concerns. Technology in its various forms has been proposed as a solution to most - if not all - of the aforementioned issues,
      between carbon sequestration, increased employment and medical developments, to name but a few examples. Network technology specifically has also been
      considered as an approach to address these issues, most often by harnessing the near-instantaneous and global nature of online communication. Food security
      has been proposed as one target of technoimprovement, for example through IoT crop monitoring and data-driven supply redistribution. Another locus of
      amelioration can be found in global health, with transnational and institutional medical collaboration permitted and fostered by network technology. Other
      areas of application involve data-based predicting, preventing and warning, such as in climate catastrophes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, network technology is not a solution in and of itself but a tool like any other, the function of which is predicated on the desires of its
      creator and the implementation of which is left to the imagination of its users. In this sense, and to contest a naive perspective of hard technological
      determinism, it is important to consider the socio-cultural milieu in which technologies arise, as cultural critics Barbook and Cameron’s in their 1996
      "Californian Ideology" or Mueller in the more recent <a href="https://www.boundary2.org/2018/07/mueller/" target="_blank">Digital Proudhonism</a>.  A strong
      example of this is facial recognition software, which has been increasingly decried as inherently racially biased. The space here not permitting an exhaustive
      account of the phenomenon, we can rely on the critical work of scholars such as  <a href="https://b-ok.cc/book/5329116/b8b69c" target="_blank">Ruha Benjamin</a>
      as well as <a href="https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/" target="_blank">other cultural projects</a> for an understanding of this issue. While Amazon,
      Microsoft, IBM and Facebook have limited, rolled-back or ceased their facial recognition software development, this can hardly be considered a case of
      proactive problem solving, rather than PR backpedalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some dimensions of soft technological determinism remain relevant, especially with respect to the ways in which structural factors, whether it be
      technological or mediatic landscapes, can implicitly frame, afford and coerce behaviours. This is especially true nowadays with respect to politics, religion
      and culture. The nature of connections and communication online have perhaps not fundamentally changed the way we relate as a society, but at least
      significantly accelerated and radicalized the process, emphasizing extremism and micro-cultural niching. The recent past has also exhibited a distinctly digital
      form of media determinism, going hand in hand with this technocultural accelerationism. In Two Faced, Daniel Joseph mentions Baran and Sweezy’s concept of
      "epoch-making" technologies, addressing all this in a less dogmatic fashion by pragmatically considering technologically-derived societal shifts <i>à la carte</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps one of the first matters to attend to so as to move forward in a conscientious and constructive fashion in the face of these roadblocks and pitfalls
      is to shake off our utopic considerations of novel tools - in this case network technology - a phenomenon which stems more from a reflection of our projective
      idealism than from a practical understanding of the applications thereof. Concretely though, I would shy away from proposing a methodology to determine the
      "most important [work] to do", as this could potentially play into current ideological hierarchizing tendencies which, while existing in an ecosystem providing
      crucial structural change and cultural evolution, can also evince counterproductive instances of epistemic hegemony. Indeed, the solutions must be at least as,
      if not hopefully copiously more, variegated than the issues themselves, and it is precisely this heterogeneity that allows for the parallel development of
      approaches converging on durable systemic change.
