      <h2>READING RESPONSES</h2>
      <h3>Week 10</h3>
    </header>
    <p class="q">
      One day, you get "noticed" for your great opinions and personality, and your social media presence explodes overnight. You are now a minor e-celebrity: an influencer with a significant platform. What does this change about your life? You receive an offer from Pepsi to subtly promote their soft drinks on your social media content in exchange for more money than you thought youâ€™d ever see, which you are free to spend however you like including donations to important causes, and Pepsi's promotion will bring you an even bigger online following and larger platform. How do you respond to this offer? Based on the issues brought up in the readings, how do you justify your choice to your fans and to your critics?
    </p>
    <p>
      I (un)fortunately have neither the chops nor the desire for e-celebrity. In the unlikely situations where such a scenario was to transpire, I would likely first attempt to foreclose on further public snowballing by tweaking online identity so as to stymie attempts at following. Rather than hostility, it is distaste that I have for the limelight and its essentializing and reductive implications.

      I agree with the sentiment raised by Carmen Hermosillo in her prescient 1994 essay <a href="http://folksonomy.co/?permalink=2299" target="_blank">Introducing Humdog: Pandora's Vox Redux</a> regarding the inherently self-commodifying nature of online expression in cybercommunities. While not qualitatively different from the analogous process unfolding in physical reality throughout of social circles (performativity, amplification of extremism, ideocultural silos), the particular circumstances of virtual intersubjectivity (identitary ambiguity, message deterritorialization) makes it a particularly accelerated process, the outcomes of which are rarely determined, let alone determinable, a priori.

       Though predicting one's future behaviour is an <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/14/14130/jdm14130.pdf" target="_blank">exercise in uncertainty</a>,  I am relatively confident that I would turn Pepsi down. I imagine the decision would stem from equal parts ethical and personal concerns, the former encompassing issues with global corporations per se (more so than specific shortcomings of PepsiCo of which I am not sufficiently informed, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwvAgDCOdU4" target="_blank">mythical ad</a> notwithstaning) and the latter revolving more around matters of privacy and the right to anonymity.</p>
    <p>
      More so than fans, I would be interested in this context to hear from the critics, as I assume it would be rife with what Barbrook and Cameron conceptualize in <a href="https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/californian-ideology" target="_blank">The Californian Ideology</a> as a neoconservative Gingrichian (Newtish?) technological determinism, magnified by over two decades of post-truth irony and memetic engineering. In this cultural context, the criticism could explicitly range from performative virtue (e.g. "why don't you just bite the bullet, plug some ads and donate the money to charity?") to more unironic trader bro economic liberalism. Without taking into account the fact that virtual conversation of the type an influencer would have with a critic is an activity of limited value, responses could tackle issues of corporate ethics, self-commodification or personal privacy.
