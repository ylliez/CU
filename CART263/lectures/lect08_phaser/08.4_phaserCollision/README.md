### Sprites
Sprites are, generally speaking, the images that make up a videogame. They’re frequently animated by displaying a series of frames in sequence.
Most obviously the player’s avatar (their representative on the screen if they have one) is likely to be a sprite, the images that make up their environment are probably sprites, other agents in the world are probably sprites, and so on. Nobody is obliged to use sprites in a game, but it’s certainly common to want static or animated images and sprites are how we do that.
