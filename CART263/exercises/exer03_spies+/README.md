# Exercise 3 - Spy Profile Generator+

This program will present the user with option to login to or signup for a spy profile. 
If user signs up, they are given information they can use to log in at a later time using the same username. 
When logging on, if the user fails to enter the correct password three times, their profile is deleted. 
If a user tries to login to a profile that does not exist twice, the entire database is purged to minimise the breach.
