# Exercise 3 - Spy Profile Generator+

This program will ask for user name in a text prompt. Once provided, the program will generate and save the user’s super secret spy profile using random JSON data to determine an alias, secret weapon, and password. When the user comes back later, they will need to enter their generated password to view their profile again.
