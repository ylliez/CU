    <h3>
      What do you think motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet? What defines success as an artist, in your view? By that metric, which ones of the artists mentioned in the reading do you think are successful? What are some of your favorite pieces of internet art that we might not know about?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Une question peut en cacher une autre. Indeed, to consider what motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet, we might need to first consider what motivates artists to make art more broadly. Reasons abound, from the aesthetic to the commemorative, the affective to the persuasive, the financial to the histrionic, but here is not the place and now is not the time to delve into such considerations. Thereafter arises the question of medium, which may be predicated on any number of factors, from availability (e.g. difficult to make internet art before the internet even exists), cost (e.g. painting vs. drawing), ability, access, novelty, etc.. A significant proportion of the motivation of early internet artists might be accounted for on this basis alone, with the internet simply being the most convenient and/or novel formal canvas for their contentual inclinations.

      And in fact, we find the same thematic range in early internet art, with pieces aesthetic
      (<a href="http://archive.rhizome.org/anthology/form-art.html" target="_blank">Form Art</a> - Alexei Shulgin, 1997;
      <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/" target="_blank">Jodi.org</a> - JODI, 1995), commemorative
      (<a href="https://maryflanagan.com/collection/" target="_blank">[collection]</a> - Mary Flanagan, 2002), affective
      (<a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/" target="_blank">My Boyfriend Came Back From the War</a> - Olia Lialina, 1996), persuasive
      (<a href="http://www.irational.org/" target="_blank">irational</a>, <a href="https://monoskop.org/RTMark" target="_blank">RTMark</a>), financial
      (<a href="https://spiller.si/net-art-trade/" target="_blank">net.art.trade</a> - Teo Spiller, 1999 [the various analyses of which
      particularly slap in the current cryptoart craze]), and histrionic
      (<a href="https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/documenta-done.html" target="_blank">Documenta Done</a> - Vuk Cosic, 1997).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there does seem to be a resolute McLuhanian emphasis on the medium
      itself in the case of internet art, which might survive a presentist bias
      correction accounting for the initial theorization of every novel technology
      (photography, cinema, virtual reality, etc...) as an artistic paradigm shift.
      Specific motivators might then be the unique features of the internet as a
      medium, such as immateriality, interactivity, participativity, connectivity, and
      (at the very least, the illusion of) egalitarianism.

      As for success as an artist? Growth, conveyance, exploration, survival,
      commodification, equanimity, fame. The answers can be categorical, personal,
      idiosyncratic, and nearly as numerous as there are artists themselves.
      Determining the success of an artist is an exercise in arithmetic or assumption,
      neither of which muster my immediate interest. There remain, however, some internet art practitioners and pieces that, whether essentially or circumstantially,
      have moved me or at the very least tickled my fancy. The first to come to mind are Simon Weckert's
