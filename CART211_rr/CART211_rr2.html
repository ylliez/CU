      <h3> READING RESPONSE - Week 3 </h3>
    </header>
    <p class="q"> <b>
      You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, game platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the country to your South, where they keep all their servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete. You've been hired by the recently elected government to help create a thriving local tech economy and re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be entirely owned by the monopoly conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution and is now available to be put to the service of your fellow citizens however you propose it be. What is your proposed course of action? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer begged by the question might consider technological sovereignty as a - if not the best - course of action. However, many factors would need to be taken into account to make an informed decision. What are the general relations between North Turtle Island and the country to the South? Moreover, where does the economic equilibrium stand, for example in terms of balance of trade? Also, how intertwined is the infrastructural sprawl of the two countries, specifically with respect to the Internet but also to other sectors such as energy and transport? Is the neighbor to the South a potential threat, diplomatically as well as militarily? How cooperative are we from an intelligence standpoint? In light of these questions, and speaking only to the international and macroeconomic scope of the question, technological sovereignty, as other forms of autarky be they economic, political and cultural, may fail to deliver on its promises, both pragmatically and perhaps even theoretically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it behooves up to consider the ramifications of a decision to divest from our technological dependence. If other aspects of our economy (e.g. energy, agriculture, industry, labour, to name but a few) are subject to the good graces of our neighbor to the south, these could readily be leveraged either to stymy our embryonic attempt, or even simply as a punitive countermeasure, the consequences of which could far outweigh its benefits. One need look no further back than 2018 for a worthwhile lesson in the trade war between the United States and China wherein the former imposed spontaneous and unilateral tariffs on the latter in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, promote domestic manufacturing and defend intellectual property. China's rebuke ultimately led to increases in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/business/manufacturing-trump-trade-war.html" target="_blank">manufacturing costs</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-farmers-aid/u-s-details-up-to-14-billion-in-new-aid-for-farmers-idUSKBN269261" target="_blank">agricultural sales losses</a> (offset by aid relief under the guise of a pandemic bail-out) and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-us-china-who-is-winning-the-trade-war/" target="_blank">consumer good prices</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, I would propose two courses of actions, the merits of which would be for administrative and political experts to determine. One strategy would be to initiate a covert long-term plan to attain technological independence. The most complex aspect of such a plan would be the repossession of the network infrastructure. Fortunately, this seems to be a non-issue in this scenario, given the nationalization of a single prior monopolistic conglomerate. This, however, does not address the issue of digital sovereignty. Here, our best option might be to engage in a little bit of unfair competition, for example by generously subsidizing local tech companies seeking to develop online services or server farms, maintaining an appropriately neoliberal posture on the world stage to avoid rousing suspicion by propping up various non-governmental funding opportunities or more simply by enforcing private-sector secrecy using non-disclosure agreements and heavy-handed administrative oversight. This would develop concurrently with concerted back-channel efforts to diversify international allegiances, establishing potential trade agreements and/or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58610234" target="_blank">financial deals</a> to fall back on in the wake of the economic fallout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aforementioned would be a cryptopolitical strategy, what of a steganopolitical one? More overt - so as to progressively boil the Southern frog unbeknownst to it - this option would also involve meddling in markets and diplomacy, but of a more commonplace realpolitik. We could start with some light protectionism, as we already do with the <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0228575" target="_blank">dairy industry</a> (and, to a more apocryphal extent, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quebec-maple-syrups-strategic-reserve/article575625/" target="_blank">maple syrup</a>) followed by an imperceptibly slowly more visible hand, through tariffs, quotas, perhaps even price fixing. The analogical diplomatic stance would also progress gradually, though no less out in the open, from meetings on the margins of summit to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/" target="_blank">trade agreements</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But putting aside practical and pragmatic considerations, let us briefly return to the underlying theory of technological sovereignty. A slew of recent heavily-mediatized events of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/31/us-spied-on-merkel-top-eu-officials-through-danish-cables" target="_blank"> cyberespionage</a> and <a href="https://cap.banq.qc.ca/notice?id=p::usmarcdef_0006363635" target="_blank">election</a> <a href="https://libgen.fun/book/index.php?md5=1BCE07AB1B741F54E9B706C671DD5B26" target="_blank">meddling</a> provides a strong argument amongst many for greater online privacy, which seems to go hand in hand with technological sovereignty, but we cannot forget the hypothetical downsides of cybersovereignty framed by nation-states. Like bizarre forms of <a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/2019/08/cloudwatt-orange-cloud-souverain-fin/" target="_blank">postcolonial technological chauvinism</a> (which is apparently not the same thing as <a href="https://thelivinglib.org/technochauvinism/" target="_blank">technochauvinism</a>, etymology be damned; read here for a tangent on reappropriating the term technochauvinism from definitions sufficiently encompassed by technological determinism, technosolutionism and technofundamentalism).
      More perilously, while we are lucky to have a <span style="color:#fa6070"><sup>m</sup>A<sub>g</sub>n<sup>I</sup>F<sub>I</sub>c<sup>E</sup>N<sub>t</sub> <sup>L</sup><sub>e</sub>A<sup>d</sup>e<sub>R</sub></span> at the head of our post revolutionary <sub>and yet somehow recently "elected"</sub> government, it is worth noting that autarky is not only phonetically proximitous to autocracy, a phenomenon the technology sector has <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/06/china-3" target="_blank">unfortunately</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/world/europe/belarus-minsk-technology.html" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/world/americas/bolsonaro-social-networks.html" target="_blank">been</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/apr/03/jailed-for-using-grindr-homosexuality-in-egypt" target="_blank">exempt</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55960284" target="_blank">from</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Perhaps then, the most pertinent frame of analysis here is not international economics but <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/3/13/digital-colonialism-is-threatening-the-global-south/" target="_blank">digital imperialism</a>.  <br>If we can dream? Maybe something along the lines of a truly transnational non-profit organization or labour-managed firm financed by national access fees proportional to GDP, with incentives for commitment to net neutrality and egalitarian infrastructural distribution.
