    <p class="q"> <b>
      It is the year 2023 and the COVID pandemic is ongoing due to a new "omicron variant" that mutated to be immune to all existing vaccines. You are a hacker with a day job as a software technician for a university research lab which has been developing a new COVID-19 vaccine capable of stopping the omicron variant and is almost done with trials. You are one of the few people with access to the private server network where the vaccine data is stored.
      The research is funded by a company that sells face masks and hand sanitizer, and has seen its value more than quadruple over the course of the epidemic. The company has also been branching out and investing in online videoconferencing and enterprise software used by work-from-home employees. This company will own the patent to the vaccine and fully control its distribution. All the scientists who performed the research are worried and believe their vaccine should be freely available to everyone around the world as soon as it is confirmed safe.
      How do you help them? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the formulation of the prompt, we can assume that the funding source for these new COVID-19 vaccine trials is ethically questionable, given its vested commercial interest in a handful of pandemic-related businesses. There appears to be some concern, given its IP-derived control over distribution, that the company might hamper availability, presumably to maintain its previous pandemically-derived profit(ability). However - though far from absolving the company and the pharmaceutical industry at large - this particular hypothetical course of action seems unlikely given the high financial burden of such a pharmaceutical development process, as well as the explosive social burden of withholding medical solutions. The scientists are nonetheless right to be concerned, as the more likely alternative to self-sabotaging retention is patent-restricted monopolistic distribution. As Amaka Vanni explains in <a href="
      https://twailr.com/on-intellectual-property-rights-access-to-medicines-and-vaccine-imperialism/" target="_blank">On Intellectual Property Rights, Access to Medicines and Vaccine Imperialism</a>, this internationally-condoned monopolistic set-up does make vaccines and other pharmaceutical products available but only along preexisting geopolitical and sociocultural fault lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that nothing illegal, or even all that immediately unethical - to not broach the issue of systemic structures of corporate research and oligarchy - has been done yet. This is not meant to relieve the hypothetical company of responsibility, but rather to speak to the limited legal options. Corporate funding of scientific research is not unheard of, and if appropriately disclosed, is legally sound. Much more tragically, nor is TRIPS-derived pharmaceutical neoimperialism, a commonplace occurrence both intra- and internationally. As a hacker endeavouring to help the concerned scientists, however, my interests would likely align with groups such as <a href="https://peoplesvaccine.org/" target="_blank">The People's Vaccine</a>. So how do we approach this ethical quandary? One option would take more of a legal route, while the other would rest more heavily on social dynamics. Either way, we will likely have to bide out time.
    </p>
    <p>
       Given my unique position as a software technician for a university research lab develpping the vaccine, my first step would probably be to secure the research development data, seeking counsel so as to develop a more covert approach than Aaron Swartz' in his tragic attempt at supporting Open Science. Next, we would need to consider who would be the best recipient or audience for this information, keeping in mind the stated goal of making the vaccine available to the most people, rather than making a political statement and/or setting a legal precedent in and of itself. So, assuming the company patents its vaccine, then markets it at price-gouging rates, all within the international IP legal framework, our best bet might simply be to try to play national and/or corporate interests against each other. For example, making the vaccine data freely available might foster situations wherein we could shift responsibility onto larger-scale actors with more bargaining weight, such as harnessing national interests to jeopardize the application of TRIPS (see Vanni's example of South Africa and AIDS medication, where the country, gingerly but ultimately successfully, contended with international patent law to reduce medication cost). Another possibility would be to play in to current anticorporate sentiment by drumming up anger at the company in question. While this has been done in other whistleblowing contexts, it might be amplified here by the immediate and concrete availability of the released data, making the gatekeeping process more transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way, it is worth keeping in mind the fate that often awaits those that dip their toes in the confluence of cybersecurity and corporate interest, from Edward Snowden, to Daniel Ellsberg, Aaron Swartz and Chelsea Manning. While contemporary cryptographic methods give the impression of the possibility of anonymity, the overwhelming weight of corporate and government interests is a heavy burden to bear.
