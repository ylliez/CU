      Reading Response 5
    </h1>
    <h3>
       After graduation, you get hired as a web designer for a successful tech company similar to the ones described in the readings. One day, someone in management makes a mistake and you are given access to a document you shouldn't have seen, which contains the list of all employees' salaries. You notice that for the same job position and level of experience, women employees are always paid less than men, on average 20% less. Women represent about 25% of the entire company. Who do you talk to about this? What do you do about the situation? How do you think your bosses will react to your actions?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Based on the language use, it is not unreasonable to assume that the hypothetical successful tech company fits within the <a href="https://www.payequitychrc.ca/sites/payequity/files/2021-07/Pay_Equity_Committees_IPG.pdf" target="_blank">criteria</a> governing the establishment of pay equity committees according to the <a href="https://chrcreport.ca/pay-equity.html" target="_blank">Canadian human rights commission</a>. As such, a first step would be to determine whether the company has established a Pay Equity Plan. The recent implementation of the <a href="https://canadagazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2021/2021-07-07/html/sor-dors161-eng.html" target="_blank">Pay Equity Act</a> makes this a legal obligation. Different levels of reporting exist, depending on the context and gravity of the situation. It would be wise to first reach out to union representatives, organizational ombuds&lpar;wo&rpar;men or at least trusted colleagues, to ensure that the assessment of the situation is shared. Next, a complaint would be lodged with the relevant provincial worker's compensation board, which in Qu&eacute;bec is the <a href="https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/fr" target="_blank">Commission des normes, de l'&eacute;quit&eacute;, de la sant&eacute; et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; du travail</a> &lpar;CNESST - document <a href="https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/en/forms-and-publications/pay-equity-work-complaint-form" target="_blank">5061-A</a>&rpar;. The <a href="https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/en/node/1145996/how-pay-equity-complaints-process-works" target="_blank">ensuing process</a> is extensively described by the CNESST.
